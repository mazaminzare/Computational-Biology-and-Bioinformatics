    "RNA folding is the process by which a single-stranded RNA molecule acquires its functional three-dimensional structure. This structure is crucial for the RNA's function, whether it's involved in protein synthesis, regulation, or catalysis. RNA folding is driven by the sequence of nucleotides and the interactions between them."
