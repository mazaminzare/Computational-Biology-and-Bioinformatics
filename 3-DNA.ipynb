        "\n",
        "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is the hereditary material in almost all living organisms. It carries the genetic instructions used in growth, development, functioning, and reproduction. This tutorial will cover the structure, functions, replication, and repair mechanisms of DNA.\n",

        "## 1. Structure of DNA\n",
        "\n",
        "DNA is a long polymer made up of nucleotides, each consisting of a sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The structure of DNA is famously known as a double helix.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Sugar**: Deoxyribose, a five-carbon sugar.\n",
        "- **Phosphate Group**: Links the sugar of one nucleotide to the sugar of the next.\n",
        "- **Nitrogenous Bases**: Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G).\n",
        "\n",

        "  - **Adenine (A)** pairs with **Thymine (T)** (2 hydrogen bonds).\n",
        "  - **Cytosine (C)** pairs with **Guanine (G)** (3 hydrogen bonds).\n",

        "\n",
        "### Transcription\n",
